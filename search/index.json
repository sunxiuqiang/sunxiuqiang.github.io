[{"content":"Please input your gene expression file. Compressed formats of \u0026ldquo;.gz\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;.zip\u0026rdquo; are accepted.The input data should be a square matrix of gene expression profiles for all patients. Each column represents the patient ID, and each row represents a gene name which can be either symbol name (e.g., TGFB1) or Entrez ID (e.g., 7040).Note: The gene expression value should be normalized toward a control sample which could be either normal tissues related with a cancer type or mixture sample from diverse tumor samples. The log2(RPKM+1) values from a RNA-seq experiment may not be meaningful unless a good reference control is available to adjust the batch effect and cancer type difference. In our study, we used the all sample average in each study as the normalization control.\n","date":"2025-01-07T17:16:14+08:00","permalink":"https://example.com/p/%E7%A4%BA%E4%BE%8B/","title":"示例"}]
